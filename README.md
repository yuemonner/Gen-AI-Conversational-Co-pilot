# Gen-AI-Conversational-Co-pilot

### Assumptions for a Conversational Gen-AI Co-Pilot for Engineers Wiki Agent

The following assumptions are made to design a high-level architecture for a conversational Gen-AI co-pilot that will serve as an internal Wiki Agent for engineers. This solution aims to assist product engineers globally by providing quick, relevant information derived from internal documentation and other knowledge sources.

#### Assumptions:

1. **User Base and Interaction:**
   - **Target Users:** Engineers
   - **Interaction Mode:** Users will interact with the co-pilot through a web-based application interface.

2. **Documentation and Knowledge Base:**
   - **Document Sources:** Internal documentation, wiki pages, technical manuals, and best practices guides stored as PDF files.
   - **Document Storage:** These documents are stored in Amazon S3 buckets for scalability and easy access.
   - **Document Size:** Approximately 500 pages of PDF documents, split into manageable chunks for processing.

3. **Embedding and Semantic Search:**
   - **Embedding Model:** Pre-trained embedding models such as Sentence Transformers will be used to convert text into vector representations.
   - **Vector Database:** A vector database service like Qdrant will be used to store and query embeddings.

4. **Large Language Model (LLM):**
   - **Model:** GPT-4 will be used for generating responses based on the retrieved chunks of information and user queries.

5. **Prompt Template and Response Generation:**
   - **Prompt Template:** The input to GPT-4 will be structured using a prompt template that includes the user query, retrieved document chunks, and any relevant chat history.
   - **Response:** The LLM will generate a relevant response that is delivered back to the user interface.

AWS Architecture:

Network Setup:

A highly available setup using VPC, subnets across two AZs, NAT Gateway, and Load Balancer ensures seamless and secure connectivity.

Scalability and Availability:

Deployed across multiple AZs for redundancy.
Load balancing and auto-scaling to handle varying loads.

ECS and ECR:

Docker containers hosted in ECS, managed by Fargate, ensure scalable and efficient deployment.
Separate containers for frontend, backend, and vector database functions.
Data Storage and Processing:

Documents stored in S3.
Embeddings stored in a vector database within ECS.
Queries processed by the backend, embeddings retrieved, and results generated by GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.
Security and Compliance:

Managed by AWS services like Cognito for authentication, Secrets Manager for sensitive data, and Certificate Manager for secure communications.
Comprehensive monitoring and logging through CloudWatch.

Operational Efficiency:

CI/CD pipeline managed by GitHub Actions ensures continuous integration and deployment.
Security Measures:

Authentication and Authorization: Managed by AWS Cognito.
Data Encryption: Encrypted at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and TLS.


#### High-Level Design:

User Interaction:
API Gateway, Cognito for secure access.

Storage and Processing:
S3 for document storage.

ECS for running containers (frontend, backend, vector DB).

Compute and Scaling:
Fargate for serverless container management.
Load Balancer for high availability.

Security:
IAM, Secrets Manager, Certificate Manager for secure operations.

Monitoring:
CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.

External API:
Access to OpenAI via NAT Gateway.

Data Flow:

User queries via API Gateway.
Queries processed by backend container in ECS.
Embeddings queried from vector database.
GPT-4 generates responses using document chunks.
Responses sent back to users via API Gateway.


Scalability:

Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.
Auto-scaling and load balancing for handling varying loads.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Managed by GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.


Security Measures:

User authentication via Cognito.
Data encryption with AWS KMS and TLS.
IAM policies for access control.

**Threat Modeling:

Identify potential threats to the system, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.
Implement mitigations for each identified threat, such as robust authentication, data encryption, and regular security audits.

**Zero Trust Security Model:

Verify every request as though it originates from an open network.
Ensure least-privilege access, micro-segmentation, and multi-factor authentication.
